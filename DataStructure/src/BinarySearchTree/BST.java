    This implementation of the ordered symbol-table API uses a binary search tree built from Node objects
     that each contain a key, associated value, two links, and a node count N. Each Node is the root of a
     subtree containing N nodes, with its left link pointing to a Node that is the root of a subtree with smaller
      keys and its right link pointing to a Node that is the root of a subtree with larger keys. The instance
      variable root points to the Node at the root of the BST (which has all the keys and associ- ated values in
      the symbol table).

    These implementations of get() and put() for the symbol-table API are characteristic recursive BST methods
    that also serve as models for several other implementations that we consider later in the chapter. Each

    opening comment.
